# Download-Time-Calc

Little python script that calculates
how long it takes to download a certain file
given a unit and size, it also can figure out
ones internet speed at runtime via the optional
dependency `speedtest`

Linux only - Needs Python 3.8+ - `speedtest` is optional

really just for learning some basic python concepts

see TODO-dl-time.py for more info and things todo
(not in this repo)
